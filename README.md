Response - Site Generator
--------------------------------------

A Yeoman generator for generating multiple kinds of sites using sub generators

## What does the site generator do?
Probably too much! It asks you what kind of site you want to build, takes your answers - and spits out a perfectly scaffolded website complete with goodies such as: asset pipelines, live reload, image optimisation and more...


## Getting Started

### What is Yeoman?
Think of Yeoman as a made-to order service for repetitive tasks.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. Find yeoman here: [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. *Make sure you update regularly.*

Then, install Yeoman globally:

```
$ npm install -g yo
```

## This isn't registered with Yeoman - how do I install the generator?
Check back soon...

## How do I get this running?
Check back soon...

## What needs to be added:
Lots of things need to be added:

  - Sub-Generators, Sub-Generators, Sub-Generators...
  - Convert Sub-Generator callbacks to promises
  - Tidy the console logging
