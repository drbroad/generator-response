Response - Site Generator
--------------------------------------

A Yeoman generator for generating multiple kinds of sites using sub generators

## What does the site generator do?
Probably too much! It asks you what kind of site you want to build, takes your answers - and spits out a perfectly scaffolded website complete with goodies such as: asset pipelines, live reload, image optimisation and more...


## Getting Started

### What is Yeoman?
Think of Yeoman as a made-to order service for repetitive tasks.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. Find yeoman here: [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. *Make sure you update regularly.*

Then, install Yeoman globally:

```
$ npm install -g yo
```

## This isn't registered with Yeoman - how do I install the generator?
Check back soon...

## How do I get this running?
Check back soon...

## What needs to be added:
Lots of things need to be added:

  - Sub-Generators, Sub-Generators, Sub-Generators...
  - Convert Sub-Generator callbacks to promises
  - Tidy the console logging
  - Remove conditionals from bower.json, instead use iterations and install with --save-dev
  - add gulp to dependencies
  - build out gulpfiles
  - tidy up WP install
  - Configure all composer,bower, package files with app name, author etc
  - configure content defaults based on the install type
  - decouple as much as possible!
  - refine the clean task
  - develop the logging task
  - list potential subtasks needed
  - using git as a submodule?
  - list of plugins/theme options
  - clean unused themes except 2014
  - prompt for git remote
  - init git at the very end of everything
  - create a less/aseets subgenerator?
  - create repo for design assets
  - remove unwanted themes
  - add our author stuff to the response theme
  - make logger a special color, make the warn a brighter colour
